<h3> <p align = "center" > Lyrics </p> </h3>
<hr>

<p align = "center"> Every night in my dreams  <br/>
    I see you, I feel you <br/>
    That is how I know you go on <br/>
</p>

<p align = "center">Far across the distance <br/>
    And spaces between us <br/>
    You have come to show you go on<br/>
    <p/>

    <p align = "center"> Near, far, wherever you are<br/>
    I believe that the heart does go on <br/>
    Once more, you open the door <br/>
    And you're here in my heart<br/>
    And my heart will go on and on<br/>
    </p>

    <p align = "center"> Love can touch us one time <br/>
    And last for a lifetime <br/>
    And never let go 'til we're gone<br/>
    </p>

    <p align = "center"> Love was when I loved you <br/>
    One true time I'd hold to <br/>
    In my life, we'll always go on<br/>
</p>

<p align = "center">  Near, far, wherever you are <br/>
    I believe that the heart does go on (why does the heart go on?) <br/>
    Once more, you open the door <br/>
    And you're here in my heart <br/>
    And my heart will go on and on<br/>
   </p> 
    
    <p align = "center"> You're here, there's nothing I fear<br/>
    And I know that my heart will go on <br/>
    We'll stay forever this way <br/>
    You are safe in my heart and <br/>
    My heart will go on and on  <br/>
    </p>
